#MongoDB Community Repository

Welcome to the MongoDB community repo! This repo includes content for MongoDB User Group (MUG) organizers. MUGs are intended for networking and collaboration for people who who share an interest in development and operations best practices with MongoDB.

## MUG Download Program

The MUG Download Program helps organizers around the globe and includes the following content:

- Presentations and notes: We release new content every month in the MUG Download folder for you to share with your MUG. If you’re a MUG organizer and want to receive alerts when a new deck is released, send an email to [Meghan](mailto:meghan@mongodb.com), and she’ll get you set up.
- [Digital survey](http://database.mongodb.com/community-survey): This survey creates a feedback loop between your members and MongoDB and helps us improve the content we provide.
- Best practices: We've gathered best practices from community leaders on organizing great MUGs into a [MUG guide](https://www.mongodb.org/community/playbook).
- Support from MongoDB: We can help coordinate MongoDB engineers, customers, and partners to speak at your MUG.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:community@mongodb.com).
